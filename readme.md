Predicting Pneumonia in chest x-rays using Deep learning techniques. This is a deep learning model to predict pneumonia in human body with the help of convolution neural network. The data set has been taken from kaggle which contain over 5000 images of human body chest xrays. Simple Sequential model has been used to predict if a person is having Pneumonia.
